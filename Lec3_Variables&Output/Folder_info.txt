This is the lecture 3 of learning DSA with c++
Topic is - Variable in c++ and Output/Input

1. to print hello world in c++

Variables -->
1. lowercase - teacontainer
2. uppercase - INTCONTAINER
3. camelcase - teaContainer

Variables decleration -->
int apple = 4 Here (int - datatype) (apple - variable) (4 - value)

Datatypes in c++ programming language 
1. Primary 2. Derived 3. User Defined

Primary Datatypes -->
1. int
2. char - denoted in single quotes ('')
3. boolean
4. floating point datatype -- this allows to 7 decimal for ex. 7.3145677 
5. double floating point datatype - this allows to 15 decimal for ex. 7.314567731456775
6. void 
7. wide character 
8. string datatype - denoted in single quotes (" ")

input in c++ -->
here "cin" is used for taking input from user
for ex :-
int apple;
cin>>apple;

Output in c++ -->
here "cout" is used in taking output
for ex :-
int apple;
cout<<apple;
