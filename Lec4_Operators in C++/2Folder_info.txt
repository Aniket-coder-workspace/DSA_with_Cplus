Operators in C++ -->

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Misc Operators


1. Arithmetic Operators -->
. + Additon
. - Substraction
. * Multiplication
. / Division
. % Modulus -- Use for to find "remainder"
. ++ Increment
. -- Decrement  


2. Relational Operators --> This give "true = 1" or "false = 0"
. == is equal to
. != not equal to
. > greater than
. < less than
. >= greater than eual to 
. <= less than eual to

3. Logical Operators --> 
. && (logical AND) Expere. 1 and Expere. 2 both are true so ans:- true
. || (logical OR) Expere. 1 and Expere. 2 both are false so ans:- false
. ! (logical NOT) Expere. 1 and Expere. 2 can be changed (true to false) or false to true

4. Assignment Operators -->
. =
. +=
. -=
. /=
. %= 

5. Bitwise Operators -->
. ~ Bitwise Complement
. << Left shift -- multiply by 2
. >> Right shift -- divide by 2
. | Bitwise OR
. & Bitwise AND
. ^ Bitwise exclusive OR  

6. Misc Operator -->
. SizeOf operator 
. condition ? expression1 : expression2
. Comma operator 
. dot and arrow operator
. casting operator
. & Address operator
. * pointer operator

7. Unary operators -->
. + Unary plus
. - Unary minus
. ++ Increment operator --> This is Post - incremen
. -- Decrement operator --> This is Pre - increment 

[Post - increment operator & Pre - increment operator]

for ex:- 
int a = 7;
cout<<a++; it first print it then incremnt it // here output is 7

int b = 8;
cout<<++b; it first incremnt it then print it // here output is 9
