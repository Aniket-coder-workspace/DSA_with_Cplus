Operators in C++ -->

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Misc Operators


1. Arithmetic Operators -->
. + Additon
. - Substraction
. Multiplication
. / Division
. % Modulus -- Use for to find "remainder"
. ++ Increment
. -- Decrement  


2. Relational Operators --> This give "true = 1" or "false = 0"
. = is equal to
. ! not equal to
. > greater than
. < less than
. >= greater than eual to 
. <= less than eual to

3. Logical Operators --> 
. && (logical AND) Expere. 1 and Expere. 2 both are true so ans:- true
. || (logical OR) Expere. 1 and Expere. 2 both are false so ans:- false
. ! (logical NOT) Expere. 1 and Expere. 2 can be changed (true to false) or false to true

4. Assignment Operators -->
. =
. +=
. -=
. /=
. %= 

5. Bitwise Operators -->
. ~ Bitwise Complement
. << Left shift
